# CATS REVEAL GHOSTS

A 3D exploration game with random mechanics.

You are a little witch in a dream and you need to find the exit. Every level is randomized with ghosts and cats scattered in it. All ghosts are invisible but can be seen by cats. The cats will always look at the ghost on their tile if there is one. The goal is to find your way around to reach the end. You have to find the exit as fast as possible to have the maximum of points in the end.

There are 3 difficulty settings with different points attribution.
- Easy: the easy mode generates a small size level and then randomly place ghosts and cats around. There is a normal quantity of cats around the map and less ghosts. The size of the map varys between 20 to 30 tiles. Nothing changes on the death of the player.
- Normal: the normal mode generates a medium size level and then randomly place ghosts and cats around. There is a normal quantity of cats and a normal quantity of ghosts. The size of the map varys between 30 to 40 tiles. On death, there is a new generation of cats and ghosts with different positions.
- Hard: the hard mode generates a big size level and then randomly place ghosts and cats around. There are less cats and a normal quantity of ghosts. The size of the map varys between 40 to 50 tiles. On death, there is a new generation of the level so everything is changed.

Developped over the course of 3 weeks.
